# To-Do List

## Feature Suggestions (Pending Approval)

### Functional
- [ ] **URL State Sharing**: Encode knot parameters (equations, colors, growth) into the URL hash to allow sharing via link. (Zero-backend persistence).
- [ ] **Audio Reactivity**: Animate tube thickness or distortion based on microphone input or audio file.
- [ ] **Video/GIF Recording**: Built-in tool to record a perfect loop of the knot animation.

### Design / Visuals
- [ ] **Post-Processing (Bloom/Glow)**: Add "Unreal Engine" style glow and chromatic aberration effects.
- [ ] **Advanced Materials (Matcaps)**: Add support for metallic, iridescent, and chrome textures (Matcaps) instead of just single colors.
- [ ] **Gradient Coloring**: Allow the color to shift along the length of the tube (e.g., Hue shift).

## Backlog
- [ ] Refactor `Knot.svelte` to support custom materials better.
- [ ] Optimization of geometry updates for mobile performance.
