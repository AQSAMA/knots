# Plan

## Goal
Provide a dedicated equations section separate from the settings panel so equation edits stay visible without covering the knot.

## Steps
1. Split the customize overlay into an equations dock and a settings panel.
2. Adjust responsive positioning and scrolling so both sections are usable on mobile.
3. Capture a UI screenshot of the new layout.
4. Run the existing lint/check/build scripts after changes.
