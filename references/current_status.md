# Current Status

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Project:** Knots UI
**Focus:** Settings overlay visibility

## Summary
- Repositioned the settings panel to a right-aligned, scrollable layout to keep the knot visible while editing equations.
- Captured the updated overlay screenshot and ran lint/check/build scripts (lint/check still report existing issues).

## Next Steps
1. Address review feedback if needed.
