# Task Plan

- [x] Review the settings overlay layout and the knot view to confirm where the overlap occurs.
- [x] Adjust the settings panel layout so equations stay visible without covering the knot (responsive positioning/scrolling).
- [x] Update status/plan docs to reflect the new UI fix work.
- [x] Verify with existing lint/check/build scripts and capture a UI screenshot.

## Review
- Moved the customize panel to a right-aligned, scrollable layout to keep the knot visible.
- Captured `references/settings-overlay-update.png` showing the updated UI.
- Verified lint/check/build outputs (existing lint/check failures remain unrelated).
