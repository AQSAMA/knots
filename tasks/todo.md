# Task Plan

- [ ] Review the settings overlay layout and the knot view to confirm where the overlap occurs.
- [ ] Adjust the settings panel layout so equations stay visible without covering the knot (responsive positioning/scrolling).
- [ ] Update status/plan docs to reflect the new UI fix work.
- [ ] Verify with existing lint/check/build scripts and capture a UI screenshot.
